## Introduction

Scoria AI leverages blockchain technology to provide a decentralized platform for artificial intelligence agents. By using a combination of federated learning, zero-knowledge proofs, and on-chain processing, Scoria AI ensures that data remains private and secure. Our framework supports various programming languages and technologies, making it adaptable for different use cases.

## Features

- **Decentralization**: Operate without a central authority.
- **Privacy**: Keep user data secure with on-device processing.
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with multiple blockchain networks, including Solana.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handle a growing number of users and transactions.
- **Support for AI Models**: Integrate with ONNX and TensorRT for seamless AI model deployment.
- **Flexible Language Support**: Built with Rust and TypeScript for enhanced performance and usability.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilize DAO and DeFi functionalities for governance and financial operations.
- **Secure Inference**: Ensure that AI inferences are conducted securely using advanced cryptographic techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with Scoria AI, you will need to set up your development environment. This section will guide you through the initial steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployments)
- Access to a Solana wallet (for blockchain interactions)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/premkumar610/Scoria-AI.git
cd Scoria-AI
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to run the project in a Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Configuration

Before running the application, you may need to configure your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following variables:

```env
BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=solana
WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address
AI_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/your/model.onnx
```

## Usage

Once you have everything set up, you can start using Scoria AI. Here‚Äôs how to run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

### Interacting with the Framework

You can interact with Scoria AI through the API. Here are some common endpoints:

- **POST /api/agents**: Create a new AI agent.
- **GET /api/agents/{id}**: Retrieve the details of an AI agent.
- **POST /api/inference**: Perform inference using a specified AI model.

### Example Request

Here‚Äôs an example of how to create a new AI agent:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agents -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "model": "model.onnx"
}'
```
